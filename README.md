This project could be used to hiding the images uploaded by service users to hide the image in the cloud storage.
ths is already preent in the market but we are makingthe protection of images from hacker much more effiicient.Even if the hacker somehow gets your image file it will be just the overlapping image and not the real image.
Abstract-
Cloud-based data storage offers several advantages over traditional paper records and client-server systems, especially when it comes to securing image data. As organizations look to the cloud for their image data storage needs, addressing security challenges becomes paramount. Cryptography plays a pivotal role in ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of image data in cloud-based systems.
Managing encryption keys can be complex, especially in scenarios with multiple data owners and security domains within image data storage. To address these challenges, a distributed attribute-based encryption scheme is proposed, allowing access to image data from any source using a single key, thereby simplifying key management.
In addition to traditional cryptography, the integration of Hadamard-based techniques can further enhance the security of image data in the cloud. Hadamard transforms, known for their role in signal processing and data compression, can be applied to encrypt and protect image data. By incorporating Hadamard transforms into the security framework, it is possible to introduce an additional layer of security and data integrity.
In this proposed system, a combination of multiple cryptographic algorithms, including RC6 (Rivest Cipher 6), is utilized alongside image steganography to ensure image data security. All cryptographic algorithms used employ 128-bit keys, and LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography is used to securely store key information, which includes details about the encrypted portions of the image, the algorithms used, and their respective keys.
During the encryption process, the image is processed using Hadamard transforms and split into two parts, each of which is encrypted simultaneously using different encryption algorithms, facilitated by multithreading techniques. The key information is then concealed within an image using LSB steganography. This comprehensive approach guarantees better security and protection of image data by securely storing encrypted data and using the combined strength of steganography, cryptographic algorithms like RC6, and Hadamard transforms to bolster image data security within the cloud-based storage system.
Incorporating Hadamard transforms into this security strategy can provide an added layer of complexity and effectiveness in securing sensitive image data, ensuring that it remains confidential and tamper-resistant while stored in the cloud.
